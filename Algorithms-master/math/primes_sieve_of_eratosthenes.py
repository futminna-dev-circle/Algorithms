'''
Using sieve of Eratosthenes, primes(x) returns list of all primes less than x

Modification:
We don't need to check all even numbers, we can make the sieve excluding even
numbers and adding 2 to the primes list by default.

We are going to make an array of: x / 2 - 1 if number is even, else x / 2 
(The -1 with even number it's to exclude the number itself)
Because we just need numbers [from 3..x if x is odd]

# We can get value represented at index i with (i*2 + 3)

For example, for x = 10, we start with an array of x / 2 - 1 = 4
[1, 1, 1, 1]
 3  5  7  9

For x = 11:
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
 3  5  7  9  11  # 11 is odd, it's included in the list

With this, we have reduced the array size to a half,
and complexity it's also a half now.
