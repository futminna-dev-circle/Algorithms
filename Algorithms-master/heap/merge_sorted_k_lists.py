"""
I think my code's complexity is also O(nlogk) and not using heap or priority queue,
n means the total elements and k means the size of list.

The mergeTwoLists functiony in my code comes from the problem Merge Two Sorted Lists
whose complexity obviously is O(n), n is the sum of length of l1 and l2.

To put it simpler, assume the k is 2^x, So the progress of combination is like a full binary tree,
from bottom to top. So on every level of tree, the combination complexity is n,
beacause every level have all n numbers without repetition.
The level of tree is x, ie logk. So the complexity is O(nlogk).

for example, 8 ListNode, and the length of every ListNode is x1, x2,
x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, total is n.

on level 3: x1+x2, x3+x4, x5+x6, x7+x8 sum: n

on level 2: x1+x2+x3+x4, x5+x6+x7+x8 sum: n

on level 1: x1+x2+x3+x4+x5+x6+x7+x8 sum: n
