"""
Given a set of candidate numbers (C) (without duplicates) and a target number
(T), find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T.

The same repeated number may be chosen from C unlimited number of times.

Note:
All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
For example, given candidate set [2, 3, 6, 7] and target 7,
A solution set is:
[
  [7],
  [2, 2, 3]
]
